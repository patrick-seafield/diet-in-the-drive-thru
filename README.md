> CS 361 - Group 4 Project: Diet in the Drive Thru

This is based on nuxt-community/express-template.

nuxtjs.org and vuejs.org for documentation. It's not bad as far as js docs go!

## Basics
The pages directory contains the "pages". They automatically get routes generated for them.

The express / database side is located in server/ and server/api.



# Automated documentation (read me!)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm build
$ npm start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Backpack

We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
